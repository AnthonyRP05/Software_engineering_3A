# POO

For maven build:
run as maven build->
clean package javadoc:javadoc
Then you have two jar files in "target"
To exec them use in the order:
1- java -jar POO-Server.jar
2- java -jar POO-Client.jar

For JavaDoc:
See in target.site.apidocs

You cannot write xml files with .jar, use main class to do
