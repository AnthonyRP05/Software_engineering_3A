# POO

For maven build:
mvn clean package javadoc:javadoc
Then you have two jar files in "target"
To exec them use in the order:
1- java -jar POO-Server.jar
2- java -jar POO-Client.jar

For JavaDoc:
See in target.site.apidocs

You cannot write xml files with .jar, use main class to do so.

If you encounter any problems during the execution do not hesitate to email someone in the group or send a message on Teams.

We hope you like our project, if you do, don't hesitate to put a star ‚≠ê
